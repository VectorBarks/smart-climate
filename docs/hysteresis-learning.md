# AC Temperature Window Detection (HysteresisLearner)

Smart Climate Control v1.1.0+ includes an advanced AC temperature window detection system that learns your AC's cooling cycle behavior for enhanced prediction accuracy.

## What is AC Hysteresis?

AC units don't cool continuously. Instead, they cycle on and off based on internal temperature thresholds:

- **Start Cooling**: When room temperature rises above a threshold (e.g., 24.5°C for a 24°C target)
- **Stop Cooling**: When room temperature drops below a different threshold (e.g., 23.5°C)
- **Hysteresis Window**: The temperature range between start/stop points (1°C in this example)

This behavior prevents short cycling and provides comfortable temperature control, but creates challenges for smart thermostats trying to predict AC behavior.

## How HysteresisLearner Works

The HysteresisLearner system automatically detects and learns your AC's temperature windows using power monitoring:

### 1. Power Transition Detection
- Monitors AC power consumption to detect when cooling starts/stops
- **Cooling Start**: Power increases from idle/low to moderate/high
- **Cooling Stop**: Power decreases from moderate/high to idle/low
- Records room temperature at the moment of each transition

### 2. Threshold Learning
- Collects room temperature samples during power transitions
- Calculates median values for robust learning (immune to outliers)
- **Start Threshold**: Median room temperature when AC begins cooling
- **Stop Threshold**: Median room temperature when AC stops cooling

### 3. Hysteresis State Detection
Based on learned thresholds and current conditions, determines AC cycle position:
- **`learning_hysteresis`**: Not enough data yet to determine thresholds
- **`active_phase`**: AC is actively cooling (high power consumption)
- **`idle_above_start_threshold`**: AC is off, room temp above start point
- **`idle_below_stop_threshold`**: AC is off, room temp below stop point
- **`idle_stable_zone`**: AC is off, room temp between thresholds

### 4. Enhanced Predictions
- Factors hysteresis state into offset predictions
- Different states yield different prediction patterns
- Improves learning accuracy by understanding AC cycle context

## Requirements

**Essential**:
- Power sensor monitoring your AC's electrical consumption
- Home Assistant climate entity for your AC
- Room temperature sensor

**Power Sensor Types**:
- Smart plugs with power monitoring (easiest for plug-in ACs)
- Whole-home energy monitors with CT clamps
- Built-in power reporting (some smart AC units)
- Dedicated power meters

**Without Power Sensor**:
- HysteresisLearner automatically disables
- System continues normal operation using existing learning methods
- No errors or warnings displayed

## Configuration

### Automatic Detection
When you configure a power sensor, HysteresisLearner automatically enables. No additional configuration required.

### Power Thresholds
Smart Climate automatically detects power state transitions, but you can fine-tune thresholds in the UI:

**Configurable Thresholds**:
- **Power Idle Threshold**: Below this = AC idle/off (default: 50W)
- **Power Min Threshold**: Below this = AC at minimum (default: 100W)  
- **Power Max Threshold**: Above this = AC at high/max (default: 250W)

**Example for Different AC Sizes**:

```yaml
# Small Window Unit (5,000-8,000 BTU)
power_idle_threshold: 30W
power_min_threshold: 80W
power_max_threshold: 600W

# Medium Split System (12,000-18,000 BTU)  
power_idle_threshold: 50W    # Default values
power_min_threshold: 100W
power_max_threshold: 1200W

# Large Central AC (24,000+ BTU)
power_idle_threshold: 100W
power_min_threshold: 300W
power_max_threshold: 3000W
```

### Learning Parameters
HysteresisLearner uses sensible defaults but can be customized:

- **Minimum Samples**: 5 transitions required before thresholds are considered reliable
- **Maximum Samples**: 50 recent transitions kept for threshold calculation
- **Median Calculation**: Robust against temperature sensor outliers

## Understanding Your AC's Behavior

### Internal Sensor Thermal Dynamics

Many users observe "odd" behavior with internal AC sensors that's actually perfect for HysteresisLearner:

**During Active Cooling**:
- Internal fan runs, mixing warm room air with cold evaporator
- Sensor reads averaged temperature (e.g., 20.8°C for 20.8°C target)
- Temperature matches target due to airflow mixing

**After Cooling Stops**:
- Fans stop, no airflow mixing occurs
- Sensor reads pure evaporator coil temperature
- Temperature drops significantly (e.g., from 20.8°C to 16°C)
- Evaporator stays cold for several minutes before warming

**Why This Happens**:
- Evaporator coil has thermal mass and stays very cold after compressor stops
- Without airflow, sensor measures actual coil temperature, not room average
- Coil gradually warms toward room temperature over 10-30 minutes

**Perfect for Learning**:
- **Clear Transitions**: 4-5°C difference makes state detection trivial
- **Reliable Patterns**: Consistent temperature behavior enables robust learning
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: System quickly learns your AC's specific cooling cycle

### Real-World Example

**AC Configuration**: Target 20.8°C, internal sensor at evaporator
- **Cooling Active**: Sensor shows 20.8°C (mixed air temperature)
- **Cooling Stops**: Sensor drops to 16°C (pure evaporator temperature)
- **Gradual Rise**: Sensor slowly climbs back toward room temperature

**HysteresisLearner Response**:
- Detects clear 4.8°C transition pattern
- Learns this is normal behavior, not malfunction
- Uses pattern to predict future cooling cycles
- Improves offset accuracy by understanding AC state

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Debug Logging
Enable detailed logging to monitor HysteresisLearner operation:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.smart_climate: debug
```

**Example Debug Output**:
```
DEBUG: Power transition detected: idle -> moderate (85W -> 1250W)
DEBUG: Recording start transition at room temp: 24.4°C
DEBUG: Updated start threshold: 24.2°C (5 samples)
DEBUG: Hysteresis state: active_phase
DEBUG: Enhanced prediction with hysteresis context: -1.8°C
```

### Learning Progress
Monitor learning progress through entity attributes:

```yaml
# Hysteresis learning status
hysteresis_enabled: true
hysteresis_has_sufficient_data: true
hysteresis_start_threshold: 24.2
hysteresis_stop_threshold: 23.7
hysteresis_samples_collected: 12
hysteresis_current_state: "idle_stable_zone"
```

### Performance Metrics
HysteresisLearner maintains performance requirements:
- **Prediction Time**: <0.0001s (well under 1ms requirement)
- **Memory Usage**: Bounded by max_samples configuration
- **Learning Accuracy**: Improves over 5-10 cooling cycles

## Benefits and Use Cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Hysteresis not learning"**:
- Verify power sensor is working and updating regularly
- Check power thresholds match your AC's consumption patterns
- Ensure AC actually cycles on/off (some units run continuously)
- Allow 5-10 cooling cycles for initial learning

**"Inconsistent thresholds"**:
- Room temperature sensor may be in poor location
- External factors affecting room temperature (sun, appliances)
- AC may have variable behavior (different modes, defrost cycles)
- Consider increasing minimum samples requirement

**"Poor prediction accuracy"**:
- Learning may need more time (20+ cycles for full accuracy)
- Power thresholds may not match AC behavior
- Room sensor placement issues
- Check debug logs for hysteresis state accuracy

### Performance Issues

**Slow Learning**:
- Increase AC usage to provide more learning samples
- Verify power transitions are being detected
- Check that thresholds are being updated in logs

**Memory Concerns**:
- Default 50 sample limit keeps memory usage reasonable
- Reduce max_samples if needed for resource-constrained systems
- Sample data is automatically cleaned up

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Learning Parameters

While not exposed in UI, advanced users can modify learning behavior:

```python
# In custom component development
hysteresis_learner = HysteresisLearner(
    min_samples=10,    # Require more samples for reliability
    max_samples=100    # Keep more history for better accuracy
)
```

### Integration with Other Systems

HysteresisLearner state can be used by other automations:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Optimize AC based on cycle position"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: climate.smart_ac
        attribute: hysteresis_current_state
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes.hysteresis_current_state == 'idle_above_start_threshold' }}"
    action:
      - service: script.prepare_for_cooling_cycle
```
