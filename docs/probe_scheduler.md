# Intelligent Probe Scheduler (v1.5.3-beta)

## Overview

The Intelligent Probe Scheduler is a revolutionary enhancement to Smart Climate Control that solves the traditional 30-day confidence building problem. Instead of fixed 24-hour probe intervals that disrupt comfort, it uses context-aware intelligence to determine the optimal moments for thermal calibration.

### The Problem with Fixed Intervals

Traditional thermal learning systems rely on fixed probe schedules (e.g., every 24 hours) that:
- Force temperature drift regardless of occupancy
- Disrupt comfort during active use periods
- Generate statistically invalid data through clustering
- Stress HVAC equipment with excessive cycling
- Disturb sleep even with "quiet hours"

### The ProbeScheduler Solution

**Paradigm Shift**: From "how often should we probe?" to "is now a good and useful time to probe?"

The ProbeScheduler combines three key factors:
1. **Opportunity**: Is this a good time (user away, calendar free)?
2. **Information Gain**: Will this probe teach us something new?
3. **System Stability**: Has enough time passed for recovery?

### Key Benefits

- **Faster Learning**: Reach 80%+ confidence in days instead of weeks
- **Zero Comfort Impact**: Only probes when you're away
- **Intelligent Diversity**: Prioritizes temperature conditions not yet explored
- **Equipment Protection**: Respects minimum intervals for HVAC health
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works even with minimal sensor availability

## Architecture

### Decision Framework

The ProbeScheduler makes intelligent decisions using this hierarchy:

```
Should Probe Now?
├── System Recovery Check (minimum 12-hour interval)
├── Opportunity Assessment
│   ├── Presence Detection (primary)
│   ├── Calendar Integration (secondary)
│   ├── Manual Override (tertiary)
│   └── Quiet Hours (fallback)
├── Information Gain Analysis
│   ├── Temperature Bin Coverage
│   ├── Historical Data Diversity
│   └── Current Conditions Value
└── Maximum Interval Enforcement (force probe after 7 days)
```

### Core Components

#### ProbeScheduler Class
```python
class ProbeScheduler:
    def should_probe_now(self) -> bool:
        """Main decision method combining all factors."""
    
    def check_abort_conditions(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        """Monitors for conditions requiring probe termination."""
    
    def handle_partial_probe_data(self, duration, tau, quality, reason):
        """Processes data from interrupted probes."""
```

#### Integration with ThermalManager
```python
# Opportunistic probing from stable states
if self._current_state in [ThermalState.DRIFTING, ThermalState.CORRECTING]:
    if self.probe_scheduler.should_probe_now():
        self.transition_to(ThermalState.PROBING)
```

## Configuration

### Learning Profiles

The ProbeScheduler offers four learning profiles to balance comfort and learning speed:

#### Comfort (Recommended for Most Users)
- **Min Interval**: 24 hours (less disruptive)
- **Presence Required**: Yes (only when away)
- **Information Threshold**: 0.6 (high confidence required)
- **Quiet Hours**: Strictly enforced (22:00-07:00)
- **Best for**: Users who prioritize comfort over learning speed

#### Balanced (Default)
- **Min Interval**: 12 hours (standard learning)
- **Presence Required**: Yes (opportunistic scheduling)
- **Information Threshold**: 0.5 (standard confidence)
- **Quiet Hours**: Enforced with exceptions
- **Best for**: Most users, good balance of learning and comfort

#### Aggressive (Power Users)
- **Min Interval**: 6 hours (rapid learning)
- **Presence Required**: No (may probe when present)
- **Information Threshold**: 0.3 (accepts lower confidence)
- **Quiet Hours**: Advisory only
- **Best for**: Users who want fastest learning regardless of comfort

#### Custom (Advanced Users)
- **All Parameters**: User-configurable
- **Advanced Settings**: Full control over thresholds
- **Expert Mode**: Manual tuning of all decision factors
- **Best for**: Technical users who understand the system

        min_probe_duration_minutes: 20
        temperature_bins: [-5, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45]
```

### Entity Configuration

#### Presence Detection Hierarchy
The ProbeScheduler uses a graceful degradation strategy:

1. **Primary**: Presence entity (`binary_sensor.home_occupied`)
   - Most reliable when available
   - Direct occupancy detection
   - Immediate response to presence changes

2. **Secondary**: Calendar integration (`calendar.work_schedule`)
   - Work schedule proxy for presence
   - Predictive scheduling during work hours
   - Reduces dependency on presence sensors

3. **Tertiary**: Manual override (`input_boolean.probe_override`)
   - User-controlled probe scheduling
   - Emergency override capability
   - Temporary presence simulation

4. **Fallback**: Quiet hours only
   - Conservative probing during sleep hours
   - Rare but predictable scheduling
   - System continues functioning without sensors

#### Weather Integration
```yaml
# Weather entity for outdoor temperature tracking
weather_entity_id: weather.home
# Enables temperature bin adaptation and abort conditions
```

## User Guide

### Initial Setup

1. **Configure Learning Profile**: Start with "Balanced" for most users
2. **Add Presence Detection**: Configure `presence_entity_id` for optimal results
3. **Optional Enhancements**: Add weather and calendar entities
4. **Monitor Learning**: Watch confidence metrics in first week

### Understanding Status

The ProbeScheduler provides comprehensive status information through sensors:

#### Probe Scheduler Status Sensor
```yaml
sensor.living_room_ac_probe_scheduler_status:
  state: "Ready for opportunistic probing"
  attributes:
    learning_profile: "balanced"
    next_probe_eligible: "2025-08-19T02:30:00Z"
    days_since_last_probe: 1.2
    confidence_level: 0.76
    temperature_bin_coverage: 0.8
    probes_collected: 23
    presence_status: "away"
    information_gain_available: true
    quiet_hours_active: false
```

#### Key Status Indicators

**Probe Readiness**:
- `"Minimum interval not met"` - Too soon since last probe
- `"Waiting for opportunity"` - System ready, waiting for absence
- `"Ready for opportunistic probing"` - All conditions favorable
- `"Maximum interval exceeded - forcing probe"` - Emergency scheduling

**Presence Detection**:
- `"Presence detected - waiting"` - User present, probe delayed
- `"Away - opportunity available"` - Optimal probing window
- `"Calendar busy - waiting"` - Work schedule blocks probing
- `"Manual override active"` - User-controlled scheduling

**Learning Progress**:
- `temperature_bin_coverage`: 0.0-1.0 (diversity of conditions learned)
- `confidence_level`: Current system confidence
- `probes_collected`: Total thermal calibrations completed

### Best Practices

#### Optimal Presence Detection
- Use reliable presence sensors (not just motion)
- Consider using person entities for multi-occupant homes
- Enable mobile app presence for accurate away detection
- Configure presence zones appropriately

#### Calendar Integration Tips
- Use work calendar for predictable away periods
- Create dedicated "Thermal Learning" calendar for fine control
- Set calendar events for extended away periods
- Consider vacation/holiday calendars

#### Information Gain Optimization
- Allow system to experience full temperature range
- Don't manually override during learning periods
- Let system probe during different weather conditions
- Avoid frequent HVAC mode changes during learning

### Monitoring Performance

#### Confidence Progression
The enhanced confidence calculation provides meaningful progress tracking:

```python
# Base confidence from probe count (up to 80%)
base_confidence = min(math.log(probe_count + 1) / math.log(16), 0.8)

# Diversity bonus for temperature range coverage (up to 20%)
diversity_score = len(probed_bins) / total_bins
diversity_bonus = diversity_score * 0.2

# Combined confidence (up to 100%)
total_confidence = min(base_confidence + diversity_bonus, 1.0)
```

**Benefits**: 
- Stable climates can reach 80% confidence with fewer probes
- Variable climates can achieve 100% confidence with good coverage
- Prevents artificial confidence inflation from clustered data

#### Performance Metrics
Monitor these key indicators for system health:

**Learning Effectiveness**:
- Confidence progression over time
- Temperature bin coverage expansion
- Probe frequency and timing
- Successful vs. aborted probes

**Comfort Impact**:
- Probes scheduled during occupancy
- Sleep disruption incidents
- Manual probe interventions
- User satisfaction feedback
