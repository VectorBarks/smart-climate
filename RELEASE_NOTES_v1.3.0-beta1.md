# Smart Climate Control v1.3.0-beta1 Release Notes

## 🚀 Major Release: Advanced Intelligent Features

Smart Climate Control v1.3.0 introduces three groundbreaking intelligent features that elevate the integration from basic ML learning to advanced predictive climate control. This release represents a significant architectural advancement with sophisticated algorithms while maintaining the simplicity and reliability users expect.

## ✨ What's New in v1.3.0

### 🧠 **Adaptive Feedback Delays** - Smart AC Response Timing
Transform your climate control with intelligence that learns your AC's unique response characteristics:

- **Intelligent Learning**: Automatically discovers optimal feedback delay timing based on actual AC temperature stabilization patterns
- **Temperature Stability Detection**: Monitors temperature changes with 0.1°C precision every 15 seconds to detect when AC reaches equilibrium
- **Exponential Moving Average**: Uses sophisticated EMA smoothing (alpha=0.3) applying 70% weight to new measurements for gradual refinement
- **Safety Features**: 
  - 5-second safety buffer added to all learned delays
  - 10-minute timeout protection with graceful fallback
  - Completely backward compatible (disabled by default)
- **User Benefits**: AC units automatically optimize their feedback timing, reducing energy waste and improving comfort accuracy

### 🌤️ **Weather Forecast Integration** - Predictive Temperature Control
Experience proactive climate control that anticipates weather changes before they affect your comfort:

- **Proactive Adjustments**: Analyzes weather forecasts to make predictive temperature adjustments before conditions change
- **Smart Strategy System**: Two built-in intelligent strategies:
  - **Heat Wave Pre-cooling**: Applies -1.0°C adjustment when high temperatures forecast (>30°C for 3+ hours)
  - **Clear Sky Thermal Optimization**: Optimizes cooling efficiency during clear sky conditions
- **API Integration**: Leverages Home Assistant's reliable `weather.get_forecasts` service
- **Intelligent Throttling**: 30-minute internal throttling prevents excessive API calls while maintaining responsiveness
- **User Benefits**: Anticipates weather changes for enhanced comfort and improved energy efficiency

### 🌡️ **Seasonal Adaptation** - Context-Aware Learning
Unlock year-round accuracy with learning that adapts to seasonal outdoor temperature patterns:

- **Outdoor Temperature Context**: Enhances hysteresis learning with outdoor temperature awareness for seasonal precision
- **Temperature Bucket Matching**: Groups learned patterns by outdoor temperature ranges (5°C buckets) for relevant pattern retrieval
- **Extended Data Retention**: 45-day retention period captures comprehensive seasonal patterns
- **Robust Fallback Logic**: Gracefully degrades to general patterns when insufficient seasonal data available
- **User Benefits**: Learning system automatically adapts to seasonal conditions, providing consistent accuracy improvements throughout the year
