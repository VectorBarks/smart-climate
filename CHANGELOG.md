- **Protection**: Training data collection paused during unavailability
- **Impact**: No more crashes or errors when entities go offline

#### **ApexCharts Span Deprecation** - Issue #20
- **Fixed**: Removed deprecated span: properties from dashboard ApexCharts cards
- **Solution**: Kept graph_span: properties which are the correct way to specify time ranges
