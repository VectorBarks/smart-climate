## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive UI configuration with ALL settings available through the interface
- New UI configuration options:
  - Away Mode Temperature (10-35째C) - Fixed temperature for away mode
  - Sleep Mode Offset (-5 to +5째C) - Additional offset for quieter night operation
  - Boost Mode Offset (-10 to 0째C) - Aggressive cooling offset
  - Gradual Adjustment Rate (0.1-2.0째C) - Temperature change per update
  - Learning Feedback Delay (10-300s) - Time before recording feedback
  - Enable Learning toggle - Separate from ML enabled flag
- Options flow now includes all configuration parameters
- Configuration validation ensures away temperature is within min/max range
- Enhanced user experience with no YAML editing required for any setting
- Reset Training Data button entity for clearing all learned patterns
  - Available in device configuration section
  - Creates backup before deletion for safety
  - Allows fresh start for learning system

### Changed
- UI configuration is now the recommended method for all users
- YAML configuration is now marked as optional/advanced
- Documentation updated to emphasize UI-first configuration approach

### Improved
- User onboarding experience with comprehensive UI settings
- Configuration flexibility without requiring technical knowledge
- Ability to fine-tune all parameters through the interface
