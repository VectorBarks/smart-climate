## Usage

### Basic Operation

Once configured, the Smart Climate Control entity appears in Home Assistant as a standard climate entity with enhanced intelligence:

1. **Set Temperature**: Use the normal climate controls - the system automatically applies offset compensation
2. **Enable Learning**: Use the "{Climate Name} Learning" switch to turn on intelligent pattern learning
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch learning statistics in the switch entity attributes (samples collected, accuracy, confidence)
4. **Check Logs**: Enable debug logging to see detailed offset calculations and learning progress

### Operating Modes

Switch between modes using the preset selector:

- **None (Normal)**: Dynamic offset compensation based on current conditions
- **Away**: Fixed temperature for energy savings while away from home
- **Sleep**: Quieter operation with reduced cooling demand for nighttime
- **Boost**: Temporary extra cooling for rapid temperature reduction

### Learning Controls

The integration creates a learning switch entity for easy control:

- **Learning Switch**: Turn learning on/off with a simple toggle
- **Learning Statistics**: View samples collected, accuracy, and confidence in entity attributes
- **Persistent Learning**: Patterns are automatically saved and restored across Home Assistant restarts

### Manual Overrides

Use the companion number entities for temporary manual control:

- **Manual Offset** (-5 to +5Â°C): Override the calculated offset
- **Override Duration** (0-480 minutes): How long the manual override lasts

## How the Learning System Works

### Overview

The learning system uses a feedback mechanism to continuously improve offset predictions by measuring how well each prediction performs in practice. This creates a self-improving system that adapts to your specific AC unit and environment.

### The Feedback Loop

When you adjust the temperature, here's what happens:

1. **Offset Calculation** (T=0 seconds):
   - System calculates an offset based on current conditions
   - Example: You want 22Â°C, system predicts +2Â°C offset needed
   - Sends 20Â°C to the AC unit to compensate for its sensor inaccuracy

2. **Feedback Collection** (T=45 seconds default):
   - Measures the AC's internal sensor temperature
   - Measures the room sensor temperature
   - Calculates the actual offset that exists between them
   - Records this data to improve future predictions

3. **Learning Process**:
   - Compares predicted offset vs actual offset
   - Uses the error to refine future predictions
   - Builds patterns based on time of day, temperatures, and power usage

### What the Feedback Measures

**Important**: The feedback mechanism is NOT waiting for the room to reach target temperature. Instead, it's measuring:

- **Sensor Drift**: How the AC's internal sensor reading differs from the room sensor
- **AC Response**: How the AC unit's sensor responds to setpoint changes
- **Environmental Patterns**: How conditions affect the sensor offset

This typically stabilizes within 30-90 seconds after a setpoint change, which is why the default delay is 45 seconds.

### Configuring the Feedback Delay

The feedback delay is configurable based on your AC unit's characteristics:

```yaml
smart_climate:
  - name: "Living Room Smart AC"
    climate_entity: climate.living_room_ac
    room_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature
    learning_feedback_delay: 90  # Increase to 90 seconds for slower AC units
```

#### Choosing the Right Delay

- **Fast-responding units** (mini-splits, modern inverters): 30-60 seconds
- **Standard units**: 45-90 seconds (default: 45)
- **Slow-responding units** (older systems, large spaces): 90-180 seconds

To determine the optimal delay for your system:
1. Enable debug logging
2. Watch how long it takes for the AC's internal temperature to stabilize after changes
3. Set the feedback delay slightly longer than this stabilization time

### Learning Data Quality

The learning system includes several mechanisms to ensure data quality:

- **Offset Threshold**: Only collects feedback when an offset was actually applied
- **Sensor Validation**: Skips collection if sensors are unavailable
- **Edge Case Handling**: Properly handles entity removal and Home Assistant restarts
- **Outlier Detection**: Future versions will filter anomalous readings

### Monitoring Learning Progress

Track the learning system's performance through:

1. **Debug Logs**: Show each feedback collection and learning update
   ```
   Learning feedback collected: predicted_offset=2.00Â°C, actual_offset=2.30Â°C
   ```

2. **Switch Attributes**: Display real-time statistics
   - `samples_collected`: Total learning samples
   - `accuracy`: Prediction accuracy percentage
   - `confidence`: System confidence level
   - `mean_error`: Average prediction error

3. **Gradual Improvement**: Expect to see accuracy improve over several days as patterns emerge

### Learning System Limitations

Current limitations to be aware of:

- **Single Sample**: Currently takes one measurement per adjustment (future versions may use multiple samples)
- **Fixed Delay**: Uses a fixed delay rather than detecting stability (enhancement planned)
- **Linear Learning**: Uses exponential smoothing rather than complex ML models (by design for efficiency)

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the learning system:

- **Adaptive Delays**: Automatically adjust feedback timing based on AC behavior
- **Multi-point Sampling**: Take multiple measurements to improve accuracy
- **Stability Detection**: Wait for temperature stability rather than fixed time
- **Power-based Learning**: Use power consumption patterns to enhance predictions
- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Adjust learning rates based on seasonal changes

## Sensor Availability & Behavior

Smart Climate Control handles sensor availability gracefully to ensure reliable operation:

### Critical Sensors

**Room Temperature Sensor** (Required)
- **When Available**: Provides current room temperature for accurate offset calculations
- **When Unavailable**: The Smart Climate entity shows no current temperature (`current_temperature` becomes `None`)
- **Impact**: The system cannot calculate accurate offsets without room temperature data
- **Recovery**: Automatically resumes normal operation when the sensor becomes available again

### Optional Sensors

**Thermostat/Climate Device** (Wrapped Entity)
- **When Available**: Full climate control functionality with temperature setpoints and mode changes
- **When Unavailable**: The Smart Climate entity can still show room temperature from the sensor, but cannot control the actual device
- **Impact**: Temperature control commands will not be executed until the device becomes available
- **Recovery**: Control commands are queued and executed when the device reconnects

**Outdoor Temperature Sensor** (Optional)
- **When Available**: Enhances offset calculations with outdoor temperature correlation
- **When Unavailable**: System continues normal operation using only room temperature data
- **Impact**: Slightly reduced accuracy for outdoor temperature-dependent offset patterns
- **Recovery**: Seamlessly incorporates outdoor data when the sensor becomes available

**Power Consumption Sensor** (Optional)
- **When Available**: Provides better detection of actual cooling/heating operation
- **When Unavailable**: System relies on HVAC mode and state for operation detection
- **Impact**: Minimal impact on core functionality
- **Recovery**: Enhanced state detection resumes when power sensor becomes available

### Sensor Reliability Features

- **Graceful Degradation**: The system continues operating with available sensors
- **Automatic Recovery**: Full functionality resumes when sensors become available
- **Fallback Defaults**: Sensible defaults prevent system failures
- **Status Logging**: Sensor availability changes are logged for troubleshooting
- **No Manual Intervention**: Recovery is automatic without requiring restarts

### Important Notes

- The **room temperature sensor is critical** - without it, the system cannot calculate meaningful offsets
- All other sensors are optional and the system adapts to their availability
- Sensor unavailability is temporary in most cases (network issues, device restarts, etc.)
- The system is designed to be resilient and continue operating during sensor outages

## Advanced Features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Offset seems incorrect
- **Solution**: Check that your room sensor is properly positioned and calibrated
- **Tip**: Use the manual override to test different offset values

**Problem**: System not responding to temperature changes
- **Solution**: Verify the climate entity and room sensor are working correctly
- **Check**: Review logs for error messages or sensor communication issues

**Problem**: Learning predictions seem poor
- **Solution**: Allow more time for data collection (20+ samples minimum, 48-72 hours typical)
- **Check**: Monitor learning statistics in switch entity attributes
- **Option**: Disable learning temporarily using the switch and rely on rule-based calculations

### Logs and Debugging

Enable debug logging to see detailed system operation:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.smart_climate: debug
```

This will show:
