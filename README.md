> ðŸš€ **v1.4.1-beta4 Released**: Critical fixes for Home Assistant 2024.x compatibility. Seasonal data persistence now working.

Transform any climate device with inaccurate sensors into an intelligent, ML-powered climate control system with predictive algorithms and adaptive learning.

## The Problem

Many AC units and heat pumps have poorly placed internal temperature sensors that don't reflect actual room temperature. This creates thermal feedback loops and control instability, leading to uncomfortable spaces and wasted energy as the unit can't accurately maintain your desired temperature.

## The Solution

Smart Climate Control creates a virtual climate entity that:
- Uses your accurate room sensor instead of the AC's internal sensor
- Dynamically calculates temperature offsets using multi-factor algorithms
- Learns environmental patterns through hysteresis detection and exponential smoothing
- Predicts optimal adjustments using weather forecasts and seasonal adaptation
- Maintains your desired comfort level with sub-degree precision
