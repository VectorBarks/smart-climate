## Overview

Smart Climate Control is a Home Assistant custom integration that creates a virtual climate entity to compensate for temperature sensor inaccuracies in any climate control device. Using a hybrid approach of immediate rule-based control with background machine learning, it maintains your desired room temperature based on external trusted sensors.

### The Problem
Many climate control devices (AC units, heat pumps, mini-splits) suffer from inaccurate internal temperature sensors with offsets that vary based on:
- Outdoor temperature conditions
- Time of day and seasonal changes  
- Heat sources from neighboring units or appliances
- Device placement and airflow patterns

Simple fixed offset corrections are inadequate for these dynamic conditions.

### The Solution
Smart Climate Control dynamically calculates and applies temperature offsets in real-time, learning from your environment to provide:
- **Accurate climate control** - Maintains your desired temperature within ¬±0.5¬∞C
- **Energy efficiency** - Reduces unnecessary cycling and energy waste
- **Adaptive learning** - Improves performance over time
- **Universal compatibility** - Works with any Home Assistant climate entity

## Features

   - Click the three dots menu ‚Üí "Custom repositories"
   - Add this repository URL and select "Integration"

2. **Install**:
   - Search for "Smart Climate Control"
   - Click "Install"
   - Restart Home Assistant

3. **Configure**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
   - Click "Add Integration" 
   - Search for "Smart Climate Control"

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. **Download**: Copy the `custom_components/smart_climate` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory

2. **Restart**: Restart Home Assistant

3. **Configure**: Follow step 3 from the HACS installation above

## Configuration

### UI Configuration (Recommended)

The integration provides an intuitive setup wizard:

1. **Climate Entity**: Select your existing climate device
2. **Room Sensor**: Choose a trusted temperature sensor for the room
3. **Optional Sensors**:
   - **Outdoor Sensor**: For better offset predictions
   - **Power Sensor**: For improved state detection
4. **Settings**: Configure temperature limits, update intervals, and mode defaults

### YAML Configuration

For advanced users, YAML configuration is supported:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
smart_climate:
  - name: "Living Room Smart AC"
    climate_entity: climate.living_room_ac
    room_sensor: sensor.living_room_temperature
    outdoor_sensor: sensor.outdoor_temperature  # optional
    power_sensor: sensor.ac_power_consumption   # optional
    
    # Optional settings with defaults
    min_temperature: 16      # Minimum temperature limit
    max_temperature: 30      # Maximum temperature limit  
    max_offset: 5           # Maximum offset allowed
    update_interval: 180    # Update frequency in seconds
    
    # Mode settings
    away_temperature: 26    # Fixed temperature for away mode
    sleep_offset: 1.0       # Extra offset for sleep mode
    boost_offset: -2.0      # Extra cooling for boost mode
    
    # ML settings  
    ml_enabled: true        # Enable machine learning
    data_retention_days: 60 # Days of data to keep for training
```

## Usage

### Basic Operation

Once configured, the Smart Climate Control entity appears in Home Assistant as a standard climate entity with enhanced intelligence:

1. **Set Temperature**: Use the normal climate controls - the system automatically applies offset compensation
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch as the system learns your environment and improves accuracy over time
3. **Check Logs**: Review detailed logs showing offset calculations and system decisions

### Operating Modes

Switch between modes using the preset selector:

- **None (Normal)**: Dynamic offset compensation based on current conditions
- **Away**: Fixed temperature for energy savings while away from home
- **Sleep**: Quieter operation with reduced cooling demand for nighttime
- **Boost**: Temporary extra cooling for rapid temperature reduction

### Manual Overrides

Use the companion number entities for temporary manual control:

- **Manual Offset** (-5 to +5¬∞C): Override the calculated offset
- **Override Duration** (0-480 minutes): How long the manual override lasts

## Advanced Features

### Machine Learning

The system continuously learns from your environment to improve offset predictions:

- **Training Data**: Collects temperature readings, weather conditions, and system performance
- **Online Learning**: Updates predictions without requiring restarts
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides transparency into prediction reliability
- **Fallback Protection**: Rule-based control ensures functionality during ML training

### Power Monitoring

If you have a power sensor monitoring your climate device:

- **State Detection**: Confirms when the device is actively cooling vs. idle
- **Improved Accuracy**: Better offset calculations based on actual operation
- **Energy Insights**: Understanding of power consumption patterns

### Data Privacy

All data processing occurs locally on your Home Assistant instance:
- No cloud services or external data transmission
- Historical data stored in local SQLite database
- Configurable data retention periods

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Offset seems incorrect
- **Solution**: Check that your room sensor is properly positioned and calibrated
- **Tip**: Use the manual override to test different offset values

**Problem**: System not responding to temperature changes
- **Solution**: Verify the climate entity and room sensor are working correctly
- **Check**: Review logs for error messages or sensor communication issues

**Problem**: ML predictions seem poor
- **Solution**: Allow more time for data collection (48-72 hours minimum)
- **Option**: Disable ML temporarily and rely on rule-based calculations

### Logs and Debugging

Enable debug logging to see detailed system operation:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.smart_climate: debug
```

This will show:
- Offset calculations and reasoning
- Sensor readings and state changes
- Mode switches and manual overrides
- ML model predictions and confidence levels

## Architecture

The integration follows a modular design with clearly separated concerns:

- **SmartClimateEntity**: Main climate entity that users interact with
- **OffsetEngine**: Calculates temperature offsets using rules and ML
- **SensorManager**: Handles all sensor reading and state monitoring
- **ModeManager**: Manages operating modes and their specific behaviors
- **TemperatureController**: Applies offsets and enforces safety limits

This architecture ensures:
- **Reliability**: Component failures don't crash the entire system
- **Testability**: Each component can be thoroughly tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes debugging and enhancement easier
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without affecting existing functionality
